# Toody

Toody is a comonadic parser combinator library for parsing two-dimensional data,
such as ASCII art diagrams and 2D programming languages. Whereas most parsing
libraries are concerned with one-dimensional streams, Toody works on 2D grids of
cells, extracting data based on spatial relationships.

It is presented primarily as a proof of concept, and has not been designed for
efficiency.
